1. ## Rationale
    >The Food & Go web application is designed to cater to the needs of the people of the campus such as students, teachers, and staff members who frequently have their meals at the campus canteen. As the number of people utilizing the canteen services increases, therefore, long queues and other issues have become more prominent during peak hours. This situation can be frustrating and time-consuming causing missed classes or missed work deadlines.
